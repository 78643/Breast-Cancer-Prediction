# 🩺 Breast Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning 🧠

Welcome to my **Breast Cancer Prediction** project! This ML-based project is focused on predicting whether a tumor is **benign** or **malignant** using various classification algorithms. The goal is to assist in early detection and improve treatment outcomes.

## 🚀 Objective

Predict breast cancer diagnosis (Benign or Malignant) using features from the **Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset**.

## 🧪 Models Applied

I applied and evaluated the following models:

- 🌲 **Decision Tree (DT)**
- 📈 **Logistic Regression (LG)**
- 💡 **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** ✅ *Best Accuracy: 97%*
- 🧠 **Naive Bayes (NB)**
- 🌳 **Random Forest (RF)**

## 🔍 Key Results

| Model                  | Accuracy |
|------------------------|----------|
| Decision Tree (DT)     | ~93%     |
| Logistic Regression (LG)| ~95%     |
| Support Vector Machine (SVM) | ✅ **97%** |
| Naive Bayes (NB)       | ~92%     |
| Random Forest (RF)     | ~96%     |

## 📸 Visualizations

The project includes visual insights:
- 📊 Heatmaps for correlation
- 📉 Distribution plots of features
- 🔍 Confusion Matrix & Classification Report for each model

---

## 🧠 How it Works

1. 📥 Load & preprocess the dataset  
2. 📊 Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
3. ⚙️ Train multiple ML models  
4. ✅ Evaluate and compare model performance  
5. 🏆 Select the best model (SVM)  

---

## 📌 Conclusion

- The **SVM** model showed the highest accuracy (**97%**).
- Early prediction can greatly help in effective treatment planning.
- Model can be deployed via Flask or Streamlit for real-time predictions (future scope).
